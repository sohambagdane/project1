# IOT BASED SMART INTERACTIVE TALKING PLANT
IoT-Based Smart Interactive Talking Plant is an innovative system that uses sensors and microcontrollers to monitor a 
plant's health parameters like moisture, temperature, and light. With voice feedback and connectivity to a mobile app 
or web dashboard, the plant "talks" to users, providing real-time updates and care tipsâ€”making plant care interactive 
and engaging.
